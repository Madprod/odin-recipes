        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Baked potato rounds are topped with bacon and cheese. Great appetizer - a lot like potato skins but easier to make!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 large baking potatoes</li>
            <li>6 slices bacon</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender when pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. Drain, and cool.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Drain, cool, and crumble.</li>
            <li>Slice the potatoes into 1/4 inch rounds, and arrange them in a single layer on the baking sheet. Sprinkle a few crumbles of bacon onto each round, then top with some shredded Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is melted and lightly browned.</li>
        </ol>
